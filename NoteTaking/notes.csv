if a note is added than make sure the note is added to the database;
if a note is deleted than make sure the note is deleted from the database; * 
limit the number of list items to 5 items; * 
Use a button that opens all these notes;
make sure the note is opened like a triger with a list of all the notes and an x button to close that trigger;
